= Power Circuit

== Initial Research

After doing [research online, with links], it seems that the peak operating range of the ESP32 while engaging with Wi-Fi functionality is
in the range of 130mA with a 5V input through the regulated voltage input of the ESP32.

== Lab Work
In order to identify the bridge device's worst-case power requirements, it was supplied by a constant 5V DC voltage using a [name of power supply].
Draw to the device was monitored when initializing network drivers, and undergoing some basic tests to simulate a high-throughput environment.

Peaks of heigh [maximum height] were observed at [context], etc etc.
